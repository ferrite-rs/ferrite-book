# Getting Started

In this section, we will get a quick taste of Ferrite with a high level
overview of the language.
You will learn about how to start using Ferrite to build
a toy example program in Ferrite.

This book assumes that you already know the basic concepts in Rust,
as well as advanced concepts such as
[generic types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-00-generics.html),
[traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html),
[associated types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html),
and
[asynchronous programming](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/03_async_await/01_chapter.html).
If you haven't learned these concepts, we highly recommend you to first
read the relevant sections in the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book),
and the [Async book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book).
